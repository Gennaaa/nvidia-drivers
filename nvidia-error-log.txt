-> Performing CC check.
ERROR: The kernel header file '/lib/modules/5.6.15-1-MANJARO/build/include/linux/kernel.h' does not exist.  The most likely reason for this is that the kernel source path '/lib/modules/5.6.15-1-MANJARO/build' is incorrect.  Please make sure you have installed the kernel source files for your kernel and that they are properly configured; on Red Hat Linux systems, for example, be sure you have the 'kernel-source' or 'kernel-devel' RPM installed.  If you know the correct kernel source files are installed, you may specify the kernel source path with the '--kernel-source-path' command line option.
